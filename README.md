Daily Task Scheduler:
This project is a part of my Python Developer Internship at Asterisc Technocrat. The Daily Task Scheduler is a software solution designed to help individuals organize and manage their daily tasks and activities efficiently. The project focuses on providing a user-friendly interface with an intuitive layout and navigation for users to easily create, manage, and add reminders for their daily tasks.

Features:
User Registration and Login.   
Users can add, update, and delete tasks. Tasks include a task ID, task name, and task date.        
Users can view their tasks, which are displayed in a list format.        
Users can set reminders for specific tasks by entering the reminder time in the HH:MM format.      
Error Handling and Validation

Technologies Used:
Python programming language
Tkinter graphical user interface framework
Visual Studio Code IDE

Project Description:
The Daily Task Scheduler provides a user-friendly solution for organizing and managing daily tasks efficiently.The code utilizes the tkinter library to create a task manager application with a graphical user interface. It allows users to register and login with a username and password. Once logged in, users can perform operations such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as viewing their tasks. Additionally, users have the ability to set reminders for specific tasks by entering the desired reminder time. The code incorporates error handling and input validation to ensure data accuracy and provide a seamless user experience.

Notes:
Kindly note that the code provided serves as a simulation, and it is necessary to incorporate the actual logic for scheduling reminders using your preferred method or library.

As an aspiring learner, I continuously enhance my programming abilities by undertaking projects like the Daily Task Scheduler. This particular project serves as a testament to my growth as a Python developer and my unwavering commitment to crafting functional software solutions.
